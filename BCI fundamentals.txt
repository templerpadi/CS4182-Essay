BCI subtypes:
	Active BCI is controlled by a concious thought from the user.
	Reactive BCI gets an output from brain activity in response to an event.
	Passive BCI gets an output from arbitrary brain activity(sub-concious).

Brain Signals:
	EEG(Electroencephalogram)=Electrical signals
	(fNIRS)Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy=Oxygen blood levels using infrared light
	(MEG) Magnetoencephalography=Lagre scale EEG
	(FMRI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging=Large scale FNIRS, much higher resolution
Non-Brain Signals:
	Motion capture=reading posture
	Eyetracking
	(EMG)Electromyography=measures muscle tension

"Aspects of Cognitive State":
	Any aspect of the physica; brain state that can be measured with sufficient trial reliability.
	Tonic state:slow changing brain processes
	Phasic state: fast changing states
	Event related state: processes that are linked to a particular event

Uses:
	Disbled people: Communication, control 
	SAfety: Automatic breaking, monitoring fatigue in pilots, monitoring reactions
	Forensics: lie detection, brain fingerprinting
	Entertainment: Mood assessment, fast response detection, thought control
	Health: Sleep monitoring, neurorehabilitation
	Social: neurowear, communication
	Neuroscience: multivariate pattern analysis(brain imaging), closed loop neuroscience experiments

Scientific challenges:
related to signal processing, machine learning, computational intelligence, neuroscience, cognitive science
Difficult as processing depends on ynknown parameters
	Different brain signals from different people as cortex is folded differently
	Functional map differs with people
	Sensor locations differ across recording sessions
	Brain dynamics are constantly changing
Signal to noise ratio is very challenging
Specific measures are hard to obtain as neuron groups have lots of functions
Do not have a full understanding of the brain
Consequences:
	Sophisticated signal processing required
	All approaches are statistical
	Systems must be calibrated before use
	Calibration requires a lot of previous knowledge of the subject
